#Seleções Académicas do Porto
This project aims to connect the students in the Academy of Porto with the sports they practise.
It allows users to see the matches played of all modalities currently present in Campeonatos Académicos do Porto (Porto Academic Championships) and to know information about where it took place, who played and what the result was.

##Installation
Right now, the only way to install the application is to clone the repository and run:
```
ionic run <platform>
```
Where <platform> is either "android" or "ios". 
Make sure you have [ionic v2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/) and [cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) installed.
